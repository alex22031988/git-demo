This is your life
The clock ticks
Never truly free until you've lost everything
Our great war is a spiritual war
Our great depression is our lives

The middle children of history
No purpose or place
Always perfect but incomplete
This life

Broken
My fight, my night
Notice
My self-destruction
Breathe in
I've found the answer
Broken
I've got this, I've got this
